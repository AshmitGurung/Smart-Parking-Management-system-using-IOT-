Smart Parking Management using IOT


Introduction:-

The project entitled smart parking system is to manage all the parking facilities to an user. The recent growth in economy and due to the availability of low-price cars in the market, an every average middle-class individual can afford a car, which is good thing, however the consequences of heavy traffic jams, pollution, less availability of roads and spot to drive the motor car. One of the important concerns, which is to be taken in accounting, is the problem of parking those vehicles. Though, if there is space for parking the vehicle but so much time is squandered in finding that exact parking slot resulting in more fuel intake and not also environment friendly.


Hardware used:-

Arduino Uno

6 IR sensors

SG 90 Servo Motor

LCD Display

BreadBoard


Problem statement:-

In recent research in metropolitan cities the parking management problem can be viewed from various angles such as high vehicle density on roads. This results in annoying issues for the drivers to park their vehicles as it is very difficult to find a parking slot. 
The drivers usually waste time and effort in finding parking space and end up parking their vehicles finding a space on the street which further leads to space congestion. In worst case, people fail to find any parking space especially during peak hours and festive season. 


Description:-

The following C code is designed to run in the Arduino IDE environment and should be executed after connecting the Arduino Uno board to a power supply. The setup includes two IR sensors positioned at the gate for entry and exit detection, which control an SG90 Servo Motor acting as the gate. Additionally, there are four IR sensors, each monitoring one of the four parking slots.
